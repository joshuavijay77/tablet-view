                    Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy.
                    Oftentimes, destroying anything in her path she will take and
                    hide all your socks, shoes, and clothes for her to chew on.
                    She loves playing catch at the park, it always gives her the zoomies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog.
                    She really embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or noise at night.
                    She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it
                    laying around the house in his various favorite spots.
                    Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks,
                    but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off.
                    He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around,
                    scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too.
                    Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.

                <p>
                    Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow
                    and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and
                    will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal
                    attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another
                    dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

                <p>
                    Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats
                    (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his
                    toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really
                    excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags
                    his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

                <p>
                    Nickels was adopted from Ohio in 2010. He turned 13 years old in June 2023,
                    which he celebrated with a Taylor Swift themed birthday party. Nickels often travels
                    with his family; he has been to over ten states. He has lived in Illinois and California.
                    Nickels is a very unique dog- he is allergic to meat. His favorite word is “present.” His
                    one true joy is receiving and opening gifts with his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, Nickels’ brought home a new dog: Socks. Socks is potentially the villain in Nickels’ life.
                    He destroys Nickels’ favorite toys and is highly allergic to peanut butter, which means Nickels now
                    rarely gets his favorite treat! However, when you find them sharing a dog bed, you wonder if the sibling
                    rivalry is all a facade.

                    Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy!
                    He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly,
                    but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle
                    and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves
                    his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.
