                    Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres,
                    and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone
                    contains about half the world’s active geysers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.
                    Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.
                    You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting Yellowstone National Park:
                    Invasion of the Idiots, Tourons of Yellowstone, or  Cowboy State Daily.

                    Tokyo, originally named Edo, emerged in 1603 as a fishing village. It quickly gained political
                    power after a ‘Shogunate’, or dictatorship, took control of the area. Today Tokyo and its immediate
                    surroundings are home to the most populated metropolitan area, with a staggering 37 million people
                    residing in the region. Tokyo is also home to the largest urban economy in the world, and leads Japan
                    in business and industrial economies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tokyo is home to 23 special wards - areas like municipalities.These areas have increased monetary
                    control over their immediate areas, with political powers such as their own mayor and assembly. Being
                    the cultural, political, and business center of Japan, Tokyo is also home to a great public transport
                    system. The city has two of its own commercial airports, as well as a super-express railway.
