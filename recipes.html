                    These twice-baked potatoes work perfectly as a simple, crowd-pleasing entrée or as a rich side dish.
                    It is believed that baked potatoes originate from South America, or more specifically, Peru.
                    The Inca Indians in Peru were said to be the first to originally cultivate potatoes and when the Spanish
                    conquistadors conquered Peru, they brought the potato to Europe.

                    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
                    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

                    <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.</li>
                    <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
                    <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Shrimp scampi is a classic Italian-American delight, where succulent shrimp meet a medley of garlic,
                    butter, and white wine. Sautéed to pink perfection, the shrimp mingle with a fragrant blend of garlic
                    and red pepper flakes. A drizzle of white wine and a squeeze of lemon create a luxurious sauce, embracing
                    the dish's linguine base. With a sprinkle of parsley, it's a harmonious, flavorful masterpiece that
                    exemplifies both simplicity and taste.
